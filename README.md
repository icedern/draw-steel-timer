# Draw Steel Turn Timer

A Foundry VTT module designed for the **Draw Steel** RPG system. It adds a dramatic countdown timer during the "Director Phase" to keep combat moving.

## Features
* **Automatic Timer:** Starts a 30s countdown when a turn ends (and the Director phase begins).
* **Smart Detection:** Automatically disappears when a player activates their turn.
* **Panic Mode:** The timer pulses red and gets aggressive in the last 10 seconds.
* **GM Controls:** Hover over the timer to Pause, Restart, or Stop it.
* **Audio Cues:** Ticking sounds for the last 5 seconds and a gong when time is up.
* **Customizable:** Change the duration in Foundry's Module Settings.
